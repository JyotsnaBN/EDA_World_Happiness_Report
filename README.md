# HappinessProject
We use a dataset that gives the happiness rank and happiness score of 155 countries around the world based on seven factors 
including family, life expectancy, economy, generosity, trust in government, freedom, and dystopia residual. 
Sum of the value of these seven factors gives us the happiness score and the higher the happiness score, the lower the 
happiness rank. The purpose of this work is to find out which factors are more important to live a happier life. As a result, 
people and countries can focus on the more significant factors to achieve a higher happiness level. We will implement several 
Data Science concepts to find relations between different factors.
